# JavaSwingTimeline

This is the result from a university project where I was tasked with making a timeline with a GUI using Swing that could load and save data to a JSON file and have the user add new information or delete entries. The scenario that I chose for this project was a timeline of Super Mario games some of which are hardcoded in the JSON file for immediate use. The user is able to cycle through these entries once the application is launched. The timeline itslf is displayed using a TreeNode display that enumerates depending on the size of the JSON array making it dynamic.
